Advanced Natural Language Terminal
Overview
Welcome to the First Advanced Natural Language Terminal project! This tool allows users to interact with a command-line interface using natural language, which is then parsed into executable code. The project optimizes the power of the GPT-4o model and innovatory APIs to translate English instructions into code, execute the code, and provide real-time feedback. As the first of its kind, this project is still in progress, and we encourage contributions and feedback to help refine and expand its groundbreaking capabilities. No data will be saved, traced or stored ever by any applications or programs uploaded to this open source repository. 

Features
Natural Language Parsing: Convert English into operational code using the GPT-4o model.
Real-Time Code Execution: Execute the generated code within the terminal, with error handling and output capture.
Command Storage and Retrieval: Save and retrieve past commands for ease of use and reference.
User-Friendly Interface: Interact with the terminal naturally, making coding more accessible and intuitive.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
OpenAI API Key: You’ll need access to the GPT-4o model via the OpenAI API.
Required Python Libraries:
openai
json
sys
io
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-nlp-terminal.git
cd advanced-nlp-terminal
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai
Set Up Your OpenAI API Key:

Ensure you have your OpenAI API key set as an environment variable:
bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
Run the Terminal Interface:

bash
Copy code
python start_terminal.py
Usage
Once the terminal is running, simply type your commands in English. The system will parse your input, generate the corresponding code, execute it, and provide feedback directly in the terminal.

Example interaction:

css

Copy code
>> Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
Generated Code:
numbers = list(range(1, 11))
Execution Output:
